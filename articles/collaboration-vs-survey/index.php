      <p class="summary">A great video starts with a great script but how do you create a great script? Many online video production companies merely asked you to fill out a generic survey. Then they sent it to a so-called copywriter who is actually a freelancer in Timbuktu with no background in business let alone your business. They never talk to you, ask additional questions, or let you have input. They just fills in the blanks of a script template with your answers.</p>
