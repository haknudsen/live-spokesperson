          <p>People call them Video Spokesperson, Virtual Spokesperson, Web Spokesperson, Spokes-Model, Walk On Actor, Virtual Actor, Person On Website, Online Spokesperson, Web Presenter, Video Presenter, Website Presenter, Video Web Presenter, Promo Video Presenter, Live Actor, Website Video Actor, Virtual Live Actor, iSpokesperson and more...</p>
          <p>They are the same as as the presenters you see on Television. They communicate suggestions, news, updates, or attempting to sell. They will keep visitors' attention so they stay longer on your website. Not a simple task considering the brief attention period that many people have! That is why picking the most suitable spokesperson with the job is very important.</p>
