					<p class="card-text">You've seen them in the past. They are the people who welcome you to a website. Your video spokesperson, also know as virtual actor or website spokesperson, is a transparent video shown over a website. Instead of reading, which can get dull, these spokesperson typically walk you through whatever you need to know about the page</p>
					<p class="card-text">They are the same as as the presenters you see on Television. They communicate suggestions, news, updates, or attempting to sell. They will keep visitors' attention so they stay longer on your website. Not a simple task considering the brief attention period that many people have! That is why picking the most suitable spokesperson with the job is very important.</p>
