		<h3>What to Look for In Website Spokesperson Software</h3>
		<p>Are you looking for a virtual spokesperson to put on your home page? You need to know if the company you are currently checking out actually offers the best value for your money.</p>
		<h3>What is a Website Spokesperson?</h3>
		<p>Video spokespeople are different from the auto-play videos that are in a box that you see in most websites. A virtual spokesperson is a border-less video with a transparent background. It looks like the spokesperson stepped out of the website. This will grab the attention of website visitors, so they will listen to the spokesperson.</p>
		<h3>What options for virtual spokespersons are available?</h3>
		<p>There are many companies that offer website spokesperson software. You can choose a spokesperson and provide your own script. However, many companies charge a hefty price for their services. Some charge more than $500 for a 30-second video clip. The good news is that you can shop around. You will find services that are much more affordable and still get quality spokesperson videos.</p>
		<h3>Can You add a Spokesperson to any website?</h3>
		<p>At the bare minimum you need to be able to add a line of javascript to your page. If your web hosting service allows you to load files onto the server, you can use a website spokesperson. You do not have to write a single line of code, the company who does offer this kind of service will do all the work for you. </p>
		<p>However, with that said, you should be wary of website spokesperson software that does not allow you to host your own video on your own server. There will be nothing you could do if they accidentally remove your video from their servers. Another warning sign to look for is monthly fees for their service. A website spokesperson video should only have a one-time fee. If they require a monthly fee that the company is not worth your time or money.</p>
